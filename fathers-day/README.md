my father's day card for 2013
====

Totally not what I expected to do (I acutally expected to do something like a 
flashlight thing with HTML5 Canvas & using jQuery to do the mouse events so that
whenever you move the "flashlight" around, you get to see what's "in the dark"--
which would be something that says "HAPPY FATHER'S DAY." 


Anyways, didn't need the CSS stylesheet. Played with Javascript outside of 
HTML5 Canvas, which was nice. Used jQuery for the mouse down & up events.

Oh, and thank you CSS-TRICKS for the random hex color generator line of code. (http://css-tricks.com/examples/RandomHexColor/)
