bonvoyage card:  US --> Taiwan
====

A card for my friend who is traveling from US to Taiwan for an internship or something, I forgot.
Oh, and there's a buzzer game built in. 

Used http://www.text2speech.org/ for the voice generator at the end (if you even get there, tohoho).

Used jQuery for mouse events, again. 

Used ALGEBRA outside of school. Originally was going to use a bit of precalc because I had an arc 
dotted arrow going to Taiwan from US instead of a straight line, but then it was really late and 
I was braindead, so I gave up on that idea, (which would have looked so much better, might I add).
